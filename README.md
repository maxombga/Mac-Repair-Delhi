MakCity's Informal Repairability Score Listings for Various Electronics

Some time ago, we shared a nifty table displaying repairability scores for tablets at MakCity. It garnered quite a bit of attention, indicating that we've been providing valuable information in a less-than-ideal format. We've made some improvements, but regrettably, this is currently limited to tablets, which is somewhat limiting.

This led me to challenge myself: could I create a script to automatically extract repairability scores using only our publicly accessible API before we could generate a similar table with internal tools? The answer turned out to be a resounding yes.

It's important to note that Miro and the team are diligently working on establishing clear repairability score guidelines. Once this is finalized, our dedicated writers will revisit older teardowns to ensure consistency. As of now, these guidelines are a work in progress, so a score of 5 in 2011 may differ significantly from a 5 in 2013. We encourage you to read the teardowns and make your own judgments.
